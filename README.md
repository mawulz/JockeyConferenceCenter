This is the final project for my Human & Computer Interaction course. The website is built using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of any frameworks or libraries. The focus of this project is to implement core web development concepts in a clean, minimalistic manner, while ensuring a smooth user experience.
